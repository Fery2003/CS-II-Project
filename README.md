# CS-II-Project

This is a project we made for the *Programming II* course. It's essentially a simple *Marvel board game* ~~(if you'd be so generous as to call it that)~~ made using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) so you'll need to have that installed in order to run it.

We had to self learn JavaFX to make this project since our university only gave us the basics of the [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) library which we found absolutely **intolerable**; thus going the JavaFX route.

Thus, it's safe to say that this project is bound to have *some* bugs, so do tread this masterpiece of a game carefully! /s
